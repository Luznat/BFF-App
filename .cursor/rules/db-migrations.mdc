## Database & Migrations
When to apply: adding/editing migrations or schema-affecting changes.

* Use versioned migrations.
* Place migrations in `src/db/migrations` or `db/migration`.
* Migration file naming: `V{version}__{short_description}.sql`.
* Test migrations in a disposable environment before applying to staging/production.
