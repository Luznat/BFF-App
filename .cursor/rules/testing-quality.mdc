## Testing & Quality Gates
When to apply: creating or updating tests, or modifying quality thresholds.

* Use Jest + a React testing library for unit and component tests as applicable.
* Add integration tests where appropriate (e.g., database interactions).
* Minimum recommended coverage threshold: **85%** (raise per project risk).
* Test behavior, not implementation details.
* Test file naming conventions:
  * Unit: `*.unit.test.ts` or `*.test.ts`
  * Integration: `*.integration.test.ts`
  * E2E: placed under `tests/e2e/`

**CI must run:** lint → build → test → quality checks.
