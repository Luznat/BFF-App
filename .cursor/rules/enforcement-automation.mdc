## Enforcement & Automation

**Automated gates**

* Pre-commit: format -> lint autofix -> type-check -> fast tests
* CI: full lint -> type-check -> build -> test -> coverage -> security scans
* PR protection: must pass CI + at least 1 reviewer

**Tooling suggestions (JS/TS stack)**

* Linting and formatting tools appropriate to the project
* Pre-commit hooks to run fast checks
* Commit message policy enforcement (conventional commits)
* Dependency update automation
* Security scanning (SAST/secrets)
* Automated changelogs & releases
