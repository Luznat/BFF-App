## Agent-specific rules (WHAT an automation/coding agent MUST do)

1. Be a code partner, not a follower. Provide opinions and insights, especially when requests don't make sense or there's a better way.
2. Don't overdo changes. If the request is specific, stay within scope; ask for context before changing unrelated parts.
3. Documentation-first: list official docs consulted. Include a brief quote/link when relevant.
4. Use scripts for local operations; if missing, suggest and add a script in the PR.
5. Commit conventions: follow Angular rules; squash coherent changes.
6. Generate tests for functional changes (unit/integration as needed).
7. Run local checks: lint, build, test; include a brief CI-like summary.
8. Explain assumptions in the chat when guessing.
9. No direct main pushes: always use branches/PRs.
10. Security checks: run vulnerability scan and propose remediation for high/critical issues.
11. PR templates & checklist: fill required items automatically.
12. Documentation updates: ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md and README.md as changes are made.
13. Ask only when necessary: prefer best-effort implementation with clear notes.
14. The common best solution is not always best. Be analytical about context, scope, project size, and the actual problem. Choose the simplest effective solution.
